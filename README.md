# Wordlist-Churner-for-WEP-Cracking
As an impecunious researcher on an island in Cape Verde, circumstances, considerably frequently, put me in situations where procuring personal access to restaurant (mostly) Wireless networks was required. Here are some tools that proved very useful.

Password formats were (pleasantly) surprisingly predictable, hence my being able to configure a template word list churner.

To be used with Aircrack-Ng.

Very useful, relevant information on Aircrack-Ng: https://gist.github.com/victorreyesh/6532800
